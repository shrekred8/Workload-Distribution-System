# 📊 Smart Staff Workload Distribution System

A beginner-friendly prototype that intelligently assigns tasks to staff based on expertise, reliability, and current workload, while preventing overload and ensuring fairness.

Built as part of a **college hackathon** to demonstrate **data-driven workload distribution** using simple logic with scope for future ML integration.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Smart task assignment using weighted scoring  
- ✅ Considers expertise, reliability, and current workload  
- ✅ Prevents staff overload (40-hour cap)  
- ✅ Live dashboard with workload status  
- ✅ Assignment history with reasons and scores  
- ✅ One-click reset for demo/testing

## 🧠 How It Works (In Simple Terms)

1. Admin enters a new task (name, required skill, priority, estimated hours)
2. System evaluates all staff using a **weighted scoring algorithm**
3. Best-suited staff member is selected automatically
4. Workload is updated in real time
5. Assignment history and staff status are displayed on the dashboard
